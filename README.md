# coursera-PML-project
Course project from the Practical Machine Learning by Jeff Leek and the Data Science Track Team.

This repo contains two files:  
  
* 'WLE_analysis.Rmd' -- Rmarkdown script with project code.  
* 'WLE_analysis.html' -- report, generated by the .Rmd script.  

## Notes
Unfortunately, I cant't make .html file to be viewed by default. To see it content, please, copy link to raw html to this page: https://htmlpreview.github.io/ (the link itself is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aksyuk/coursera-PML-project/master/WLE_analysis.html).  
  
You can also view this report at RPubs: http://rpubs.com/aksyuk/coursera-PML-project.
  
In order to meet 1Mb limitation on .html size I had to make pictures as small as possible to remain clear.

Thank you for understanding!
