# coursera-PML-project
Course project from the Practical Machine Learning by Jeff Leek and the Data Science Track Team.

This repo contains two files:  
  
* 'WLE_analysis.Rmd' -- Rmarkdown script with project code.  
* 'WLE_analysis.html' -- report, generated by the .Rmd script.  

## Notes
Unfortunately, I can't make contents of .html file to be viewed by default (I will be grateful for tips in comments). To see the content, please, copy link to raw html to this page: https://htmlpreview.github.io/ (the link itself is: *https:&#58;//raw.githubusercontent.com/aksyuk/coursera-PML-project/master/WLE_analysis.html*).  
  
You can also view this report at RPubs: http://rpubs.com/aksyuk/coursera-PML-project.
  
In order to meet 1Mb limitation on .html size I had to make pictures as small as possible to remain clear.

Thank you for understanding!
